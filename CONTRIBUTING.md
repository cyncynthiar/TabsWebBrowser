This only applies as the project is small and one document
If add changes to the document as send it
If have found resources then send the resources to me with a quick explaination or problem it will solve
If have solution to issue then send quick description and solution
Or feel free to create a new branch or a local instance of it then test out and play with it
  Any changes I would happy to see


While the project is small, i can manually insert and commit those changes, or create a new branch

All help is appreciated!
